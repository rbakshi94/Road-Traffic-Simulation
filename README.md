# Overview

This project serves to make a robust, agent-based road traffic simulation software on the web. The user can create a map of roads however they like in a CAD-like interface, define traffic rules and then simulate road traffic in the domain. This project is currently in its early stages. I am currently in the process of implementing traffic AI.

The app is built in web-based languages and utilizes the HTML5 canvas element.

The app is deployed here: http://gridlock.io.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/
